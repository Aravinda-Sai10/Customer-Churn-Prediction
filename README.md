# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning
# Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by subscription-based and service-oriented businesses. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques to help organizations proactively identify customers who are likely to discontinue services and take preventive actions.
By leveraging data science, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, this system transforms historical customer data into actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making and business retention strategies.

 # Problem Statement

Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. Businesses often struggle to identify early signs of customer churn due to large volumes of customer data and complex behavioral patterns.

# Objective
To build an accurate and reliable machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn, enabling businesses to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.
# Solution Approach

This project follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow:

1- Data Collection and Understanding

2- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

3- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4- Feature Engineering

5- Model Training and Evaluation

6- Insight Generation and Reporting

A Random Forest Classifier was selected due to its robustness, ability to handle non-linear data, and strong performance on structured datasets.

# Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

Problem Type: Binary Classification (Churn / No Churn)

Evaluation Focus: Accuracy, bias reduction, and interpretability

# Results & Performance

Achieved 89% prediction accuracy

Analyzed 5,000+ customer records

Reduced model bias by 15% through feature engineering

Identified key churn indicators such as customer behavior patterns and service usage

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in identifying high-risk churn customers.

# Dataset Information

Dataset Size: 5,000+ records

Target Variable: Churn

Data Type: Structured customer data

Features Include: Demographics, service usage, account information

(Dataset used strictly for educational and analytical purposes.)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to:

Understand customer behavior trends
